# Commit Parser Plugin Configuration Example
# ===========================================
#
# The commit-parser plugin analyzes git commit messages following the
# Conventional Commits specification and automatically determines the
# appropriate version bump type.
#
# This plugin is ENABLED BY DEFAULT - you only need to configure it
# if you want to disable it.
#
# See: docs/plugins/COMMIT_PARSER.md for full documentation

path: .version

plugins:
  # Default: enabled
  # -----------------
  # The commit-parser plugin is enabled by default. You don't need to
  # explicitly enable it unless you've previously disabled it.
  commit-parser: true

  # To disable:
  # -----------
  # commit-parser: false

# Usage with bump auto
# --------------------
# The commit-parser plugin works with the `bump auto` command to
# automatically determine the version bump type from commits.
#
# $ sley bump auto
# => Inferred bump type: minor
# => Version bumped from 1.2.3 to 1.3.0

# Conventional Commit Format
# --------------------------
# type: description
# type(scope): description
# type!: description          # Breaking change
# type(scope)!: description   # Breaking change with scope
#
# Examples:
#   feat: add user dashboard
#   fix(api): handle null response
#   docs: update installation guide
#   feat!: redesign authentication flow

# Commit Type to Bump Mapping
# ---------------------------
# | Type                      | Bump  |
# |---------------------------|-------|
# | feat                      | minor |
# | fix                       | patch |
# | feat! or fix!             | major |
# | Any + BREAKING CHANGE:    | major |
#
# Types that don't trigger bumps:
# docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore

# Integration with other plugins
# ------------------------------
# plugins:
#   commit-parser: true
#   changelog-generator:
#     enabled: true
#   tag-manager:
#     enabled: true
#     prefix: "v"
#
# Flow: commit-parser analyzes commits -> version updated ->
#       changelog generated -> tag created
