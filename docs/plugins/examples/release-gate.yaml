# Release Gate Plugin Configuration Example
# ==========================================
#
# The release-gate plugin validates pre-conditions before allowing version bumps.
# This helps prevent accidental releases from dirty worktrees, wrong branches,
# or incomplete work.
#
# See: docs/plugins/RELEASE_GATE.md for full documentation

# Basic configuration - clean worktree only
# -----------------------------------------
# plugins:
#   release-gate:
#     enabled: true
#     require-clean-worktree: true

# Standard configuration - production workflow
# --------------------------------------------
plugins:
  release-gate:
    enabled: true

    # Block bumps if there are uncommitted changes
    require-clean-worktree: true

    # Block bumps if recent commits contain WIP markers
    # Detected markers: WIP, fixup!, squash!, DO NOT MERGE, DNM
    blocked-on-wip-commits: true

    # Check CI status before allowing bumps (disabled by default)
    # Set to true to require passing CI checks before version bumps
    # require-ci-pass: false

    # Only allow bumps from these branches (supports glob patterns)
    allowed-branches:
      - "main"
      - "release/*"
      - "hotfix/*"

    # Never allow bumps from these branches (takes precedence over allowed)
    blocked-branches:
      - "experimental/*"
      - "wip/*"

# Strict CI/CD configuration
# --------------------------
# plugins:
#   release-gate:
#     enabled: true
#     require-clean-worktree: true
#     blocked-on-wip-commits: true
#     require-ci-pass: true  # Enforce passing CI checks
#     allowed-branches:
#       - "main"
#     blocked-branches:
#       - "feature/*"
#       - "bugfix/*"

# Example error messages:
# -----------------------
# $ semver bump patch
# Error: release-gate: uncommitted changes detected. Commit or stash changes before bumping.
#
# $ semver bump patch  (from feature/my-branch)
# Error: release-gate: bumps not allowed from branch 'feature/my-branch'. Allowed branches: main, release/*
#
# $ semver bump patch  (with WIP commit in history)
# Error: release-gate: WIP commit detected in recent history: "WIP: work in progress"
